peculiar
in

by

the
onli
obstacl
in
the

of

the

leonardo
made
us
of
an
orthographi
peculiar
to
himself
he
had
a
fashion
of
amalgam
sever
short
word
into
on
long
on
or
again
he
would
quit
arbitrarili
divid
a
long
word
into
two
separ
halv
ad
to
thi
there
is
no
punctuat
whatev
to

the
divis
and
construct
of

nor
ar
there
ani
accent
and
the
reader
mai
imagin
that
such
difficulti
were
almost
suffici
to
make
the
task
seem
a
desper
on
to
a
beginn
it
is
therefor
not
surpris
that
the
good
intent
of
some
of
leonardo
s
most
rever
admir
should
have
fail
leonardo
literari
labour
in
variou
depart
both
of
art
and
of
scienc
were
those
essenti
of
an
enquir
henc
the
analyt
method
is
that
which
he
emploi
in
argu
out
hi
investig
and
dissert
the
vast
structur
of
hi
scientif
theori
is
consequ
built
up
of
numer
separ
research
and
it
is
much
to
be
lament
that
he
should
never
have
collat
and
arrang
them
hi
love
for
detail
research
as
it
seem
to
me
wa
the
reason
that
in
almost
all
the
manuscript
the
differ
paragraph
appear
to
us
to
be
in
utter
confus
on
on
and
the
same
page
observ
on
the
most
dissimilar
subject
follow
each
other
without
ani
connect
a
page
for
instanc
will
begin
with
some
principl
of
astronomi
or
the
motion
of
the
earth
then
come
the
law
of
sound
and
final
some
precept
as
to
colour
anoth
page
will
begin
with
hi
investig
on
the
structur
of
the
intestin
and
end
with
philosoph
remark
as
to
the
relat
of
poetri
to
paint
and
so
forth
leonardo
himself
lament
thi
confus
and
for
that
reason
i
do
not
think
that
the
public
of
the
text
in
the
order
in
which
thei
occur
in
the
origin
would
at
all
fulfil
hi
intent
no

could
find
hi
wai

such
a

leonardo

could
not

it

is

the

is
here
the

as
in

and
thi
is
worthi
of
note
when
we
connect
it
with
the
fact
that
a

the

the

that
which

the

with

of

and
outlin
displai
by
the
object
at
variou
distanc
on
the
section
of
the
book
on

the
first
thing
in
paint
is
that
the
object
it
repres

appear
in

and
that
the
ground

them
at

shall
appear
within

ar
the

of

the

the
diminut

of
these
class
of

the
first
result
from

the

ar
caus
by

interven

essenti
in

affinchè

foss
l

di
cosi
chiaro

famoso
pittor
intorno

scrive
bramantino
che
la
prospettiva
è
una
cosa
che
contrafà
il
natural
e
che
ciò
si
fa
in
tre
modi
circa
il
primo
modo
che
si
fa
con
ragion
per
esser
la
cosa
in
poch
parol
conclusa
da
bramantino
in
maniera
che
giudico
non
potersi
dir
meglio
contenendovi
si
tutta

principio
al

io
riferirò
per

le

la

adunqu
la

cioè
ragion
la
qual
fa
l
effetto
dell

facendo
crescer

calar
secondo
gli
effetti
degli
occhi
questo
crescer
e
calar
non
proced
della
cosa
propria
che
in
se
per
esser
lontana
ovvero
vicina
per
quello
effetto
non
può
crescer
e
sminuir
ma
proced
dagli
effetti
degli
occhi
i
quali
sono
piccioli
e
perciò
volendo
veder
tanto
gran
cosa
bisogna
che
mandino
fuora
la
virtù
visiva
la
qual
si
dilata
in
tanta
larghezza
che
piglia
tutto
quello
che
vuoi

ed

to
whether

not
within

it
is
imposs
that
the

should
intersect

that
is
that
it
right

cross

it

so
it
left

becom
it
right
side
becaus
such
an
intersect
demand
two
line
on

for
there
can
be
no
motion
from
right

or
from

in

without
such
extens
and
thick
as
admit
of
such
motion
and
if
there
is
extens
it
is
no
longer
a
line
but
a
surfac
and
we
ar
investig
the
properti
of
a
line
and
not
of
a
surfac
and
as
the
line
have
no
centr
of
thick
cannot
be
divid
we
must
conclud
that
the
line
can
have
no
side
to
intersect
each
other
thi
is
prove
by
the
movement
of
the
line
a
f
to

and
of
the

e
b
to
e
f
which
ar

if

a

the

with

to

c
you
will
have
move
the

f
b
toward

from
the

line
you
will
have
drawn
the
straight
line
c
d
which
cut
the
middl
of
the
intersect
of
these
two
line
at
the
point
n
without
ani
intersect
for
you
imagin
these
two
line
as
have
breadth
it
is
evid
that
by
thi
motion
the
first
will
entir
cover
the
other
be
equal
with
it
without
ani
intersect
in
the
posit
c
d
and
thi
is
suffici
to
prove
our
proposit
how
the
innumer
rai
from
innumer

can
converg
to
a
point
just
as
all

meet
at

be
without
breadth

thick
in
the

wai
all
the
imag

can
meet
there
and
as
each
given
point
face
the
object
opposit
to
it
and
each
object
face
an
opposit
point
the
converg
rai
of
the

can
pass
through
the

and
diverg
again
beyond

to
reproduc
and
re
magnifi
the

it

why
to

why
when

that

if

if

an

will
displai
stronger

in

henc
i
would
remind
you
o
painter
to
dress
your
figur
in
the
lightest
colour
you
can
sinc
if
you
put
them
in
dark
colour
thei
will
be
in
too
slight
relief
and
inconspicu
from
a
distanc
and
the
reason
is
that
the
shadow
of
all
object
ar
dark
and
if
you
make
a
dress
dark
there
is
littl
varieti
in
the
light

shadow
while
in

colour
there
ar
mani

will
displai
more

if

ar
situat

thei
will
appear
brighter
in

as
the
light

the
adversari
the
varieti
of

in

must
be
as
great
as
that
of

in

the

thi

if

it

becaus
not

be

it
ha
the

cloud
which
take

the

thi
will
suffic
us
so

as

though

that

when
the

and
it

the

let

us
that

thi

and
if

paint
the

it
is

that

deceiv
you
again
it
is
good
to
retir
to

becaus
the

look

and
your

take

when

the

so
mani

that

test
it
by

it
without

have
the

trace
on

and
lai
thi
on

you
have
made
without

and
note
carefulli
where
the

doe
not

and
where
you
find
you
have
gone
wrong
and
bear
in

not
to
repeat
the

mistak
then
return
to
the

and
draw
the
part
in
which
you
were
wrong
again
and
again
till
you
have
it
well
in

if
you

for

on
take
some

well

and
when
you
have
us
it
for
on

you
can
wash
it
clean
with
a
spong
and
make
a
second
that
a
painter
ought
to
be
curiou
to
hear
the
opinion
of
everi
on
on
hi
work
certainli
while
a
man
is
paint
he
ought
not
to
shrink
from
hear
everi
opinion
for
we
know
veri
well
that
a
man
though
he
mai
not
be
a
painter
is
familiar
with
the
form
of
other
men
and
veri
capabl
of
judg
whether
thei
ar
hump
back
or
have
on
shoulder
higher
or
lower
than
the
other
or
too
big
a
mouth
or
nose
and
other
defect
and
as
we
know
that
men
ar
compet
to
judg
of
the
work
of
natur
how
much
more
ought
we
to
admit
that
thei
can
judg
of
our
error
sinc
you
know
how
much
a
man
mai
be
deceiv
in
hi
own
work
and
if
you
ar
not
consciou
of
thi
in
yourself
studi
it
in
other
and
profit
by
their
fault
therefor
be
curiou
to
hear
with
patienc
the
opinion
of
other
consid
and
weigh
well
whether
those
who
find
fault
have
ground
or
not
for
blame
and
if
so
amend
but
if
not
make
as
though
you
had
not
heard
or
if
he
should
be
a
man
you
esteem
show
him
by
argument
the
caus
of
hi
mistak
on
the
limit
of
paint
how
in
small
object
error
ar
less
evid
than
in
larg
on
in
object
of
minut
size
the
extent
of
error
is
not
so
percept
as
in

on
and
the
reason
is
that
if
thi

or

anim
from
the

diminut
the

it

of
ordinari
appear
you
will
find
that
with
the
utmost
effort
you
cannot
persuad
yourself
to

and
the
reason
is
that
at
such
a
distanc
the
man
is
so
much
diminish
that
the
charact
of
the

cannot
be
determin
and
if

how

thi

by

you

for
thi
reason
we
often
doubt
as
to
the

of

at

why
a

can
never

detach
as

do

often
fall

of

when
thei
see

although

it

the

the

the

in
thi
by

in

cannot
diversifi
hi

by
the
variou
natur
colour
of

paint
is
not

the

when
he

that

it

that
if

it
it
is
but
a
poor
argument
to
try
to

becaus
oversight
ar
irremedi
i
should
rather
sai
that
it
will
be
more
difficult
to
improv
the
mind
of
the
master
who
make
such
mistak
than
to
repair
the
work
he
ha
spoilt
we
know
veri
well
that
a
realli
experienc
and
good
painter
will
not
make
such
mistak
on
the
contrari
with
sound
rule
he
will
remov
so
littl
at

that
he
will
bring
hi
work
to

again
the
sculptor
if
work
in
clai
or
wax
can
add
or
reduc
and
when
hi
model
is
finish
it
can
easili
be
cast
in
bronz
and
thi
is
the
last
oper
and
is
the
most
perman
form
of
sculptur
inasmuch
as
that
which
is
mere
of
marbl
is
liabl
to

not
bronz
henc
a

as
i

mai

which

could

if

thi

in

bronz

thi

is

as
ha
been

abov
or
if
you
will
have
me
onli
speak
of
paint
on

i
am
content
to
pronounc
between
it
and
sculptur
sai
that
paint
is
the
more
beauti
and
the
more
imagin
and
the
more
copiou
while
sculptur
is
the
more
durabl
but
it
ha
noth
els
sculptur
show
with
littl
labour
what
in
paint
appear
a
miracul
thing
to
do
to
make
what
is
impalp
appear
palpabl
flat
object
appear
in
relief
distant
object
seem
close
in
fact
paint
is
adorn
with
infinit
possibl
which
sculptur
cannot
command
aphor
of
paint
men
and
word
ar
readi
made
and
you
o
painter
if
you
do
not
know
how
to
make
your
figur
move
ar
like
an
orat
who
know
not
how
to
us
hi
word
as
soon
as
the
poet
ceas
to
repres
in
word
what
exist
in
natur
he
in
fact
ceas
to
resembl
the
painter
for
if
the
poet
leav
such
represent
proce
to
describ
the
floweri
and
flatter
speech
of
the
figur
which
he
wish
to
make
the
speaker
he
then
is
an
orat
and
no
longer
a
poet
nor
a
painter
and
if
he
speak
of
the
heaven
he
becom
an
astrolog
and
philosoph
and
a
theologian
if
he
discours
of
natur
or
god
but
if
he
restrict
himself
to
the
descript
of
object
he
would
enter
the
list
against
the
painter
if
with
word
he
could
satisfi
the
ey
as
the
painter
doe
though
you
mai
be
abl
to
tell
or
write
the
exact
descript
of
form
the
painter
can
so
depict
them
that
thei
will
appear
aliv
with
the
shadow
and
light
which
show
the
express
of
a
face
which
you
cannot
accomplish
with
the
pen
though
it
can
be
achiev
by
the

on
the
histori
of

that
paint
declin

henc
the

if

if

the

on

it
is
on

under

who

we

the

that

we
can
onli
conclud

then
but
the
mean
for

do
not

have

onc
forthcom
it
wa
not
perhap
until
some
year
later
that
leonardo
in
a
letter
to
the

no
remind
him
of
the
project
for
the

then
after
he
had
obei
a
summon
to

the
plan
seem
to
have
been
so
far
modifi
perhap
in
consequ
of
a
remonstr
on
the
part
of
the
artist
that
a
pace
hors
wa
substitut
for
on

and
it
mai
have
been
at

time
that
the

decid
on

to
believ
that
in

of

we
see
the

actual
carri
out
it
is
probabl
that
in

leonardo
work
less

of

as
it
would
seem
leonardo
had
not
until
then
visit

he
might
easili
have
known
thi

former

that

sai
that

that

then
the

not
thrust

inward
as
is
seen
in

b
d
to
thi
it
must
be
answer
that
thi
would
be
a
veri
poor
devic
for
three
reason
the
first
refer
to
the
strength
of
the
arch
sinc
it
is
prove
that
the
circular
parallel
be
compos
of
two
semicircl
will
onli
break
where
these
semicircl
cross
each
other
as
is
seen
in
the
figur
n
m
besid
thi
it
follow
that
there
is
a
wider
space
between
the
extrem
of
the
semicircl
than
between
the
plane
of
the
wall
the
third
reason
is
that
the
weight
place
to
counterbal
the
strength
of
the
arch
diminish
in
proport
as
the
pier
of
the
arch
ar
wider
than
the
space
between
the
pier
fourthli
in
proport
as
the
part
at
c
a
b
d
turn
outward
the
pier
ar
weaker
to
support
the
arch
abov
them
the
th
is
that
all
the
materi
and
weight
of
the
arch
which
ar
in
excess
of
the
semicircl
ar
useless
and
inde
mischiev
and
here
it
is
to
be
note
that
the
weight
place
abov
the
arch
will
be
more
like
to
break
the
arch
at
a
b
where
the
curv
of
the
excess
begin
that
is
ad
to
the
semicircl
than
if
the
pier
were
straight
up
to
it
junction
with
the
semicircl
spring
of
the
arch
an
arch
load
over
the
crown
will
give
wai
at
the
left
hand
and
right
hand
quarter
thi
is
prove
by
the

which

strength
throughout
that
portion
will
give
wai
soonest
which
is
farthest
from
it

whenc
it
follow
that
d

for

but
if

you
must
give

the

it

that
thi

a
question
here
occur
which
is
difficult
to

did
leonardo
till
he
quit
florenc
follow
the
direct
given
by
the
domin
school
of
brunellesco
which
would
then
have
given

alberti

influenc
either
through

work

and
the

of

through

wa
it
not
till
he
went

that
alberti

through

probabl
had
known
alberti
at

and
who
not
onli
carri
out
alberti
s
view
and
idea

by
hi
design
for

prove
himself
the
greatest
of

when

we
ar
here

with

we

of

there

it

i

i
believ
possibl
to
assign
the
date
with
approxim
accuraci
to
almost
all
the
fragment
and
i
am
thu
led
to
conclud
that
the
greater
part
of

anatom
investig
were
carri
out
after
the
death
of
della
torr
mere
in
read
the

book
on

which

here

it
is
imposs
to
resist
the
impress
that
the

bear
to
a

great
extent
the
stamp
of

i

it

the
follow
seem
to
be

against

rather
than
against

you
who
sai
that
it
would

better
to

in

the

ar
duller

thu
it

and
of

less
capaci
for
receiv
the
faculti
of

i
have
seen
in
the

that
the
sens
of

is
connect
with
part
of
the
substanc
of
the
brain
which
come
down
the

which
form
a

for
the

which
enter
by

the

but
the
contrari
is
to
be
seen
in

for
the

of
the

ar
but
a
small
part
of
the

and
the

ar

by

we
see

badli
at

while
these

can
see
as
well
at

as
by

the
proof
that

that
thei

do
also
advantag

everi

we
see
will
appear
larger
at

larger
in

thi
happen
becaus
the

smaller
at

the

show

why

should
twinkl
more

how
the
rai

and
add
that
if
the
twinkl
of
the

were
realli
in
the
star
as
it
seem
to
be
that
thi
twinkl
appear
to
be
an
extens
as
great
as
the
diamet
of
the

of
the

therefor
the
star
be
larger
than
the

thi
motion
effect
in

would
be
a

doubl
of
the

the

of

of

in

if

it

their

for
mani
of

ar

mani
time
larger

the

which
is
the

with

now
reflect
what
thi
our

must
look

at
such
a

consid
how
mani

be
ad
both

i
cannot

condemn

of

ancient
who
said

no

it

to

there
is
no

in

certainli
those
who
have
chosen
to
worship

as

as

saturn

and
the
like
have
fallen
into
the
gravest
error
see
that
even
if
a

were

he
would
look
no
bigger
than
a
littl
star
which
appear
but
as
a
speck
in

and
see
again
that

then
the

thi
were
the
case
these
spot
would
never
be
perman
either
as
to
posit
or
form
and
see
the
moon
from
variou
aspect
even
if
these
spot
did
not
move
thei
would
chang
in
form
as
object
do
which
ar
seen
from
differ
side
of
the
spot
on
the
moon
other
sai
that
the
moon
is
compos
of
more
or
less
transpar
part
as
though
on
part
were
someth
like
alabast
and
other
like
crystal
or
glass
it
would
follow
from
thi
that
the
sun
cast
it
rai
on
the
less
transpar
portion
the
light
would
remain
on
the
surfac
and
so
the
denser
part
would
be
illumin
and
the
transpar
portion
would
displai
the
shadow
of
their
darker
depth
and
thi
is
their
account
of
the
structur
and
natur
of
the
moon
and
thi
opinion
ha
found
favour
with
mani
philosoph
and
particularli
with
aristotl
and
yet
it
is
a
fals
view
for
in
the
variou
phase
and
frequent
chang
of
the
moon
and
sun
to
our
ey
we
should
see
these
spot
vari
at
on
time
look
dark
and
at
anoth
light
thei
would
be
dark
when
the
sun
is
in
the
west
and
the
moon
in
the
middl
of
the
sky
for
then
the
transpar
hollow
would
be
in
shadow
as
far
as
the
top
of
the
edg
of
those
transpar
hollow
becaus
the
sun
could
not
then
fling
hi
rai
into
the
mouth
of
the
hollow
which
howev
at
full
moon
would
be
seen
in
bright
light
at
which
time
the
moon
is
in
the
east
and
face
the
sun
in
the
west
then
the
sun
would
illumin
even
the
lowest
depth
of
these
transpar
place
and
thu
as
there
would
be
no
shadow
cast
the
moon
at
these
time
would
not
show
us
the
spot
in
question
and
so
it
would
be
now
more
and
now
less
accord
to
the
chang
in
the
posit
of
the
sun
to
the
moon
and
of
the
moon
to
our
ey
as
i
have
said
abov
of
the
spot
on
the
moon
it
ha
been
assert
that
the
spot
on
the
moon
result
from
the
moon
be
of
vari
thin
or
densiti
but
if
thi
were
so
when
there
is
an
eclips
of
the
moon
the
solar
rai
would
pierc
through
the
portion
which
were
thin
as
is
alleg
footnot
eclissi
thi
word
as
it
seem
to
me
here
mean
eclips
of
the
sun
and
the
sens
of
the
passag
as
i
understand
it
is
that
by
the
forego
hypothesi
the
moon
when
it
come
between
the
sun
and
the
earth
must
appear
as
if
pierc
we
mai
sai
like
a
siev
but
as
we
do
not
see
thi
effect
the
opinion
must
be
fals
other
sai
that
the
surfac
of
the
moon
is
smooth
and
polish
and
that
like
a
mirror
it
reflect
in
itself
the
imag
of
our
earth
thi
view
is
also
fals
inasmuch
as
the
land
where
it
is
not
cover
with
water
present
variou
aspect
and
form
henc
when
the
moon
is
in
the
east
it
would
reflect
differ
spot
from
those
it
would
show
when
it
is
abov
us
or
in
the
west
now
the
spot
on
the
moon
as
thei
ar
seen
at
full
moon
never
vari
in
the
cours
of
it
motion
over
our
hemispher
a
second
reason
is
that
an
object
reflect
in
a
convex
bodi
take
up
but
a
small
portion
of
that
bodi
as
is
prove
in
perspect
footnot
come
e
provato
thi
allud
to
the
accompani
diagram
the
third
reason
is
that
when
the
moon
is
full
it
onli
face
half
the
hemispher
of
the
illumin
earth
on
which
onli
the
ocean
and
other
water
reflect
bright
light
while
the
land
make
spot
on
that
bright
thu
half
of
our
earth
would
be
seen
girt
round
with
the
bright
of
the
sea
light
up
by
the
sun
and
in
the
moon
thi
reflect
would
be
the
smallest
part
of
that
moon
fourthli
a
radiant
bodi
cannot
be
reflect
from
anoth
equal
radiant
therefor
the
sea
sinc
it
borrow
it
bright
from
the
sun
as
the
moon
doe
could
not
caus
the
earth
to
be
reflect
in
it
nor
inde
could
the
bodi
of
the
sun
be
seen
reflect
in
it
nor
inde
ani
star
opposit
to
it
if
you
keep
the
detail
of
the
spot
of
the
moon
under
observ
you
will
often
find
great
variat
in
them
and
thi
i
myself
have
prove
by
draw
them
and
thi
is
caus
by
the
cloud
that
rise
from
the
water
in
the
moon
which
come
between
the
sun
and
those
water
and
by
their
shadow
depriv
these
water
of
the
sun
s
rai
thu
those
water
remain
dark
not
be
abl
to
reflect
the
solar
bodi
how
the
spot
on
the
moon
must
have
vari
from
what
thei
formerli
were
by
reason
of
the
cours
of
it
water
on
the
moon
s
halo
of
halo
round
the

i
have
found
that
the
circl
which
at
night
seem
to
surround
the
moon
of
variou
size
and
degre
of
densiti
ar
caus
by
variou
gradat
in
the
densiti
of
the
vapour
which
exist
at
differ
altitud
between
the
moon
and
our
ey
and
of
these
halo
the
largest
and
least
red
is
caus
by
the
lowest
of
these
vapour
the
second
smaller
on
is
higher
up
and
look
redder
becaus
it
is
seen
through
two
vapour
and
so
on
as
thei
ar
higher
thei
will
appear
smaller
and
redder
becaus
between

them
there
is
thicker

whenc
it
is
prove
that
where
thei
ar
seen
to
be

the

ar
most
dens

if

first
i

to
propound

conclus
it

not

that

in

that

on

that

could
not

that

refut

s
theori
as
to
the
salt
of

why
water
is
salt
plini
sai
in
hi
second
book
chapter
that
the
water
of
the
sea
is
salt
becaus
the
heat
of
the
sun
dri
up
the
moistur
and
drink
it
up
and
thi
give
to
the
wide
stretch
sea
the
savour
of
salt
but
thi
cannot
be
admit
becaus
if
the
salt
of
the
sea
were
caus
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
lake
pool
and
marsh
would
be
so
much
the
more
salt
as
their
water
have
less
motion
and
ar
of
less
depth
but
experi
show
us
on
the
contrari
that
these
lake
have
their
water
quit
free
from
salt
again
it
is
state
by
plini
in
the
same
chapter
that
thi
salt
might
origin
becaus
all
the
sweet
and
subtl
portion
which
the
heat
attract
easili
be
taken
awai
the
more
bitter
and
coarser
part
will
remain
and
thu
the
water
on

surfac
is
fresher
than
at

bottom
footnot
compar
no
but
thi
is
contradict
by
the
same
reason
given
abov
which
is
that
the
same
thing
would
happen
in
marsh
and
other
water
which
ar
dri
up
by
the
heat
again
it
ha
been
said
that
the
salt
of
the
sea
is
the
sweat
of
the
earth
to
thi
it
mai
be
answer
that
all
the
spring
of
water
which
penetr
through
the
earth
would
then
be
salt
but
the
conclus
is
that
the
salt
of
the
sea
must
proce
from
the
mani
spring
of
water
which
as
thei
penetr
into
the
earth
find
mine
of
salt
and
these
thei
dissolv
in
part
and
carri
with
them

the

and
the
other
sea
whenc
the

the

never
carri
it

and
the

would
be
salter

if

adversari
were
to
sai
that
in
infinit
time
the
sea
would
dry
up

congeal
into

to
thi
i
answer
that
thi
salt
is
restor

the

set

that

at

i
should
answer

if

as
he
who

these

that

quit

follow

i

i

that

and
thi

could
not

occur
becaus
it
would
caus

and
if
you
were
to
sai
that
the

would
rush
in
there
we
have
alreadi
conclud
that
what
is
heavi
cannot
remain
abov
what
is
light
whenc
of
necess
we
must
conclud
that
thi
delug
wa
caus
by
rain
water
so
that
all
these
water
ran
to
the
sea
and
the
sea
did
not
run
up

and
as
thei
ran
to
the
sea
thei
thrust
the
shell
from
the
shore
of
the

and
did
not
draw
them
to
ward
themselv
and
if
you
were
then
to
sai
that
the
sea
rais
by
the
rain
water
had
carri
these
shell
to
such
a
height
we
have
alreadi
said
that
thing
heavier
than
water
cannot
rise
upon
it
but
remain
at
the
bottom
of
it
and
do
not
move
unless
by
the
impact
of
the
wave
and
if
you
were
to
sai
that
the
wave
had
carri
them
to
such
high
spot
we
have
prove
that
the
wave
in
a
great
depth
move
in
a
contrari
direct
at
the
bottom
to
the
motion
at
the
top
and
thi
is
shown
by
the
turbid
of
the
sea
from
the
earth
wash
down
near
it
shore
anyth
which
is
lighter
than
the

of

anyth
which
is

than

move
suspend
in

between
the

and

bottom
and
from
these
two
conclus
which
will
be
ampli
prove
in
their
place
we
infer
that
the

of
the

cannot
convei

thei
ar
heavier
than

if
the

had

it

you
might
find
these

at

but
not
at

we

you
would
also
have

affirm
that
such

took

among

it

thi

the

as

we
shall
find

a

the

that

found

it

remark
that

the

wa
made

when

compar
no
the
river
mai
be
dam
up
at
such
a
height
that
the
water
mai
be
brought
back
to
romorantin
with
a
conveni
fall
as
to
whether
it
is
better
that
the
water
should
all
be
rais
in
a
singl
turn
or
in
two
the
answer
is
that
in
on
singl
turn
the
wheel
could
not
support
all
the
water
that
it
can
rais
in
two
turn
becaus
at
the
half
turn
of
the
wheel
it
would
be
rais
pound
and
no
more
and
if
it
had
to
rais
the
whole
pound
in
on
turn
it
could
not
rais
them
unless
the
wheel
were
of
doubl
the
diamet
and
if
the
diamet
were
doubl
the
time
of
it
revolut
would
be
doubl
therefor
it
is
better
and
a
greater
advantag
in
expens
to
make
such
a
wheel
of
half
the
size
the
land
which
it
would
water
and
would
render
the
countri
fertil
to
suppli
food
to
the
inhabit
and
would
make
navig
canal
for
mercantil
purpos
the
wai
in
which
the
river
in
it
flow
should
scour
it
own
channel
by
the
ninth
of
the
third
the
more
rapid
it
is
the
more
it
wear
awai
it
channel
and
by
the
convers
proposit
the
slower
the
water
the
more
it
deposit
that
which
render
it
turbid
and
let
the
sluic
be
movabl
like
the
on
i
arrang
in
friuli
footnot
thi
passag
reveal
to
us
the
fact
that
leonardo
had
visit
the
countri
of
friuli
and
that
he
had
stai
there
for
some
time
noth
whatev
wa
known
of
thi
previous
where
when
on
sluic
wa
open
the
water
which
pass
through
it
dug
out
the
bottom
therefor
when
the
river
ar
flood
the
sluic
of
the
mill
ought
to
be
open
in
order
that
the
whole
cours
of
the
river
mai
pass
through
fall
to
each
mill
there
should
be
mani
in
order
to
give
a
greater
impetu
and
so
all
the
river
will
be
scour
and
below
the
site
of
each
of
the
two
mill
there
mai
be
on
of
the
said
sluic
fall
on
of
them
mai
be
place
below
each
mill
a
trabocco
is
four
braccia
and
on
mile
is
three
thousand
of
the
said
braccia
each
braccio
is
divid
into
inch
and
the
water
in
the
canal
ha
a
fall
in
everi
hundr
trabocchi
of
two
of
these
inch
therefor
inch
of
fall
ar
necessari
in
two
thousand
eight
hundr
braccia
of
flow
in
these
canal
it
follow
that
inch
of

give
the

momentum
to
the
current
of
the
water
in
the
said
canal
that
is
on

and
a
half
in

and
from
thi
it
mai
be
conclud
that
the
water
taken
from

river
of

franch
and
lent
to
the
river
of

will
where
on

by

that

almost
noth

herebi
i
have
explain

why

i

that
there
ar
numberless
peopl
who
would
to

destroi

and
if
thi

were
so
necessari
to

ha
not

left
among

it
can
never
have

nor
will
it
ever

accord
to
the
definit
of
the
spirit
which
is
invis
in
substanc
for
within
the
element
there
ar
no
incorpor
thing
becaus
where
there
is
no
bodi
there
is
a
vacuum
and
no
vacuum
can
exist
in
the
element
becaus
it
would
be
immedi
fill
up
turn
over
of
spirit
we
have
said
on
the
other
side
of
thi
page
that
the
definit
of
a
spirit
is
a
power
conjoin
to
a
bodi
becaus
it
cannot
move
of
it
own
accord
nor
can
it
have
ani
kind
of
motion
in
space
and
if
you
were
to
sai
that
it
move
itself
thi
cannot
be
within
the
element
for
if
the
spirit
is
an
incorpor
quantiti
thi
quantiti
is
call
a
vacuum
and
a
vacuum
doe
not
exist
in
natur
and
grant
that
on
were
form
it
would
be
immedi
fill
up
by
the
rush
in
of
the
element
in
which
the
vacuum
had
been
gener
therefor
from
the
definit
of
weight
which
is
thi
graviti
is
an
accident
power
creat
by
on
element
be
drawn
to
or
suspend
in
anoth
it
follow
that
an
element
not
weigh
anyth
compar
with
itself
ha
weight
in
the
element
abov
it
and
lighter
than
it
as
we
see
that
the
part
of
water
have
no
graviti
or
leviti
compar
with
other
water
but
if
you
draw
it
up
into
the
air
then
it
would
acquir
weight
and
if
you
were
to
draw
the
air
beneath
the
water
then
the
water
which
remain
abov
thi
air
would
acquir
weight
which
weight
could
not
sustain
itself
by
itself
whenc
collaps
is
inevit
and
thi
happen
in
water
wherev
the
vacuum
mai
be
in
thi
water
it
will
fall
in
and
thi
would
happen
with
a
spirit
amid
the
element
where
it
would
continu
gener
a
vacuum
in
whatev
element
it
might
find
itself
whenc
it
would
be
inevit
that
it
should
be
constantli
fly
toward
the
sky
until
it
had
quit
these
element
as
to
whether
a
spirit
ha
a
bodi
amid
the
element
we
have
prove
that
a
spirit
cannot
exist
of
itself
amid
the
element
without
a
bodi
nor
can
it
move
of
itself
by
voluntari
motion
unless
it
be
to
rise
upward
but
now
we
will
sai
how
such
a
spirit
take
an
aerial
bodi
would
be
inevit
melt
into
air
becaus
if
it
remain
unit
it
would
be
separ
and
fall
to
form
a
vacuum
as
is
said
abov
therefor
it
is
inevit
if
it
is
to
be
abl
to
remain
suspend
in
the
air
that
it
should
absorb
a
certain
quantiti
of
air
and
if
it
were
mingl
with
the
air
two
difficulti
aris
that
is
to
sai
it
must
rarefi
that
portion
of
the
air
with
which
it
mingl
and
for
thi
caus
the
rarefi
air
must
fly
up
of
itself
and
will
not
remain
among
the
air
that
is
heavier
than
itself
and
besid
thi
the
subtl
spiritu
essenc
disunit
itself
and
it
natur
is
modifi
by
which
that
natur
lose
some
of
it
first
virtu
ad
to
these
there
is
a
third
difficulti
and
thi
is
that
such
a
bodi
form
of
air
assum
by
the
spirit
is
expos
to
the
penetr
wind
which
ar
incessantli
sunder
and
dispers
the
unit
portion
of
the
air
revolv
and
whirl
amidst
the
rest
of
the
atmospher
therefor
the
spirit
which
is
infus
in
thi
air
would
be
dismemb
or
rent
and
broken
up
with
the
rend
of
the
air
into
which
it
wa
incorpor
as
to
whether
the
spirit
have
taken
thi
bodi
of
air
can
move
of
itself
or
not
it
is
imposs
that
the
spirit
infus
into
a
certain
quantiti
of
air
should
move
thi
air
and
thi
is
prove
by
the
abov
passag
where
it
is
said
the
spirit
rarefi
that
portion
of
the
air
in
which
it
incorpor
itself
therefor
thi
air
will
rise
high
abov
the
other
air
and
there
will
be
a
motion
of
the
air
caus
by
it
light
and
not
by
a
voluntari
movement
of
the
spirit
and
if
thi
air
is
encount
by
the
wind
accord
to
the
rd
of
thi
the
air
will
be
move
by
the
wind
and
not
by
the
spirit
incorpor
in
it
as
to
whether
the
spirit
can
speak
or
not
in
order
to
prove
whether
the
spirit
can
speak
or
not
it
is
necessari
in
the
first
place
to
defin
what
a
voic
is
and
how
it
is
gener
and
we
will
sai
that
the
voic
is
as
it
were
the
movement
of
air
in
friction
against
a
dens
bodi
or
a
dens
bodi
in
friction
against
the
air
which
is
the
same
thing
and
thi
friction
of
the
dens
and
the
rare
condens
the
rare
and
caus
resist
again
the
rare
when
in
swift
motion
and
the
rare
in
slow
motion
condens
each
other
when
thei
come
in
contact
and
make
a
nois
and
veri
great
uproar
and
the
sound
or
murmur
made
by
the
rare
move
through
the
rare
with
onli
moder
swift
like
a
great
flame
gener
nois
in
the
air
and
the
tremend
uproar
made
by
the
rare
mingl
with
the
rare
and
when
that
air
which
is
both
swift
and
rare
rush
into
that
which
is
itself
rare
and
in
motion
it
is
like
the
flame
of
fire
which
issu
from
a
big
gun
and
strike
against
the
air
and
again
when
a
flame
issu
from
the
cloud
there
is
a
concuss
in
the
air
as
the
bolt
is
gener
therefor
we
mai
sai
that
the
spirit
cannot
produc
a
voic
without
movement
of
the
air
and
air
in
it
there
is
none
nor
can
it
emit
what
it
ha
not
and
if
desir
to
move
that
air
in
which
it
is
incorpor
it
is
necessari
that
the
spirit
should
multipli
itself
and
that
cannot
multipli
which
ha
no
quantiti
and
in
the
th
place
it
is
said
that
no
rare
bodi
can
move
if
it
ha
not
a
stabl
spot
whenc
it
mai
take
it
motion
much
more
is
it
so
when
an
element
ha
to
move
within
it
own
element
which
doe
not
move
of
itself
except
by
uniform
evapor

through

it

as
to
whether
the

whether

the

the

in

we

in

the

also
becaus
in
read
the

as
thei
occur
in

we
mai
follow
the

and
here
and
there
it
is
not
difficult
to
see
how
on

suggest
anoth
i
have
howev
regard
leonardo

as

of

have
adher

as

as
possibl
among
the

write
i
might
perhap
have
includ
the
rebuss
of

there
ar
sever
in

it
seem
to
me
not
like
that
mani
or
all
of

could
be
solv
at
the

and
the

throw
no
light
on

should
i
be
justifi
if

the

howev
it

no
my
reason
for
not
present
leonardo
to
the

as

is
the
fact
that
the

moral
in

ar
not
to

in

the

turn

never

if
the

the

never
lose

of

but
is
the
caus
of
cure
him
of

like
unto

is
the

it
never

not

if
we
had
these
instead
of
the

we
might
unhesitatingli
have
declar
that
some
unknown
italian
engin
must
have
been
at
that
time
engag
in

in
the
servic
of
the
egyptian
sultan
and
that
leonardo
had
copi
hi
document
under
thi
hypothesi
howev
we
should
have
to
state
that
thi
unknown
writer
must
have
been
so
far
on
in
mind
with
leonardo
as
to
us
the
same
style
of
languag
and
even
the
same
line
of
thought
thi
explan
might
as
i
sai
have
been
possibl
if
onli
we
had
the
finish

but
why
should
these
rough
draft
of
letter
be
regard
as
anyth
els
than
what
thei
actual
and
obvious
ar
if
leonardo
had
been
a
man
of
our
own
time
we
might
perhap
have
attempt
to
account
for
the
fact
by
sai
that
leonardo
without
have
been
in
the
east
himself
might
have
undertaken
to
write
a
romanc
of
which
the
scene
wa
laid
in
armenia
and
at
the
desir
of
hi
publish
had
made
sketch
of
landscap
to
illustr
the
text
i
feel
bound
to
mention
thi
singular
hypothesi
as
it
ha
actual
been
put
forward
see
no
note
and
it
would
certainli
seem
as
though
there
were
no
other
possibl
wai
of
evad
the
conclus
to
which
these
letter
point
and
their
bear
on
the
life
of
the
master
absurd
as
the
altern
is
but
if
on
a
question
of
such
import
we
ar
justifi
in
suggest
theori
that
have
no
foundat
in
probabl
i
could
suggest
anoth
which
as
compar
with
that
of
a
fiction
by
leonardo
would
be
neither
more
nor
less
plausibl
it
is
moreov
the
onli
other
hypothesi
perhap
which
can
be
devis
to
account
for
these
passag
if
it
were
possibl
to
prove
that
the
interpret
that
the
document
themselv
suggest
must
be
reject
a

viz
mai
not
leonardo

written
them
with
the
intent
of
mystifi
those
who
after
hi
death
should
try
to
deciph
these
manuscript
with
a
view
to
publish
them
but
if
in
fact
no

that
will
stand
the
test
of
critic
can
be
brought
against
the
simpl
and
direct
interpret
of
the
word
as
thei
stand
we
ar
bound
to
regard
leonardo
s
travel
in

as
an
establish

there
is
i
believ
noth
in
what
we

neg
such
a

especi
as
the

we

had

from

can
hardli
doubt
that

that

though

thei
show
beyond

that
next

the

the

the

had
a
special
interest
in

ey
as
a
still
further
proof
of
the
futil
of
the
argument
that
there
is
noth

to
show
that
he
